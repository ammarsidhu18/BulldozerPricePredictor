# Bulldozer Price Predictor: Project Overview
* Predicting the sale price of Bulldozers provided their attributes using Machine Learning. 
* Created a regression model on time series data that predicts sale prices for bulldozers (RMSLE).
* Data was 
* Optimized a Random Forest Regressor model using RandomizedSearchCV to achieve the most accurate model (lowest RMSLE).
